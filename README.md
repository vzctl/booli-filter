# Booli filter

  This script filters out results from booli.se based on the distance to your points of interest (work, city center, etc).
  It uses Google API to measure the transit distance, walking distance to T-bana and removes results which do not match your criteria.
  It also shows closing prices for similar apartments in the same area.
